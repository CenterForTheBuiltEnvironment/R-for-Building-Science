# Welcome!

This IDE is your workshop.. imagine that you have to built a wooden table. You need:

- wood
- space! (e.g. garage?)
- instruments (e.g. a saw..)
- instruction

Well.. if you have to develop and algorithm (or a program).. then:

- R (== wood)
- IDE (== space)
- functions (== instruments)
- documentation (== instruction)

## Familiarize with Rmd

We should spend some time in describing RStudio interface... I like to think at the IDE as separated into two columns, each 

### Basic calls 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
"Hello Cal!" # this is an explicit print.. and, btw, this is a comment!
```

```{r}
5 # this is a number.. 
```

```{r}
is.numeric(5) # this is a number.. 
```
```{r}
class(TRUE)
```

```{r}
typeof(5) # but what kind of number??
class(5)
```

```{r}
# Can I force to have another representation?
typeof( as.integer(5) )
print( as.integer(5) ) # we need to explicitly invoke the "print" function
typeof( as.character(5) )
print( as.character(5) )
```

```{r}
for (i in 1:5) {print(i)}
```

### Excercise

Print a sequence of 10 integer numbers starting from 3 (e.g. [3,4,5,..., 12]) 

Suggestion: uncomment and solve the error(s) in the following code chunch

```{r}
# x = "1"
# for (i in 1:10) {print(i + x)}
```

# Arithmetics 

We already saw an operation of sum in the previous example.. let's dig into the operators!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ar_ops <- data.frame(Operators = c("+", "-", "*", "/", "^ or **", "%%", "%/%"),
                     Names = c("Addition", "Substraction", "Multiplication",
                               "Division", "Exponential", "Remainder", 
                               "Integer Division"),
                     Example = c("x + y", "x - y", "x * y", "x / y",
                                 "x ^ y", "x %% y", "x %/% y")
                     )
knitr::kable(ar_ops)
```


## Addition

```{r}
2 + 2
sum(1,2,3)
```

## Substraction 
```{r}
4 - 2
sum(4, -3)
sum( as.numeric( c("4", "5", "-7") ) ) # example of nested functions that make Tom mad!
```

## Multiplication

```{r}
3 * 3
```

## Division

```{r}
20 / 5
```

## Exponential

```{r}
5^2
5**2
```

## Remainder

```{r}
10 %% 5
10 %% 6
10 %% 7
10 %% 8
10 %% 9
```

## Integer Division

```{r}
10 %/% 3 
```


### Exercise

Calculate the results of $ 13 * 43 $, then apply to the result a Division, Integer Division and Reminder using [7, 3, 5]   

```{r}
# 13 * 43 / 7
# ...
```

Calculate the following integer division:

```{r}
1 %/% 0.2 #https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Arithmetic.html
```

# If... Else

Logical conditions. These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops

```{r, echo=FALSE}
log_cond <- data.frame(
Operator= c( "==", "!=",">", "<",	">=",	"<="),
 Name=c("Equal","Not equal","Greater than","Less than","Greater than or equal to","Less than or equal to"),
 Example=c("x == y","x != y",	 "x > y",	 "x < y",	 "x >= y",	 "x <= y")
)
knitr::kable(log_cond)
```

  
```{r}
a <- 33
b <- 200

if (b > a) {
  print("b is greater than a")
}
```

## Excercise

Use if..else to evaluate if a number is Even or Odd.. 

![You:"I wonder why I was asked to do this.."](pics/even_odd.jpeg?raw=true "Title")

```{r}
# let's do it using the reminder
set.seed(16)
test_nr <- round(runif(n = 1, min = 1, max = 100))
# if (test_nr %% 2 == 0) {
#   print("Even!")
# } else {
#   print("Odd!")
# }
if (test_nr %% 2 == 0) {
  print(paste0(test_nr, " is Even!"))
} else {
  print(paste0(test_nr, " is Odd!"))
}
```

# Loops

## For 

```{r}
for ( i in seq(1,5,1) ) { #try (1,6,2)
  print(i)
}
````

```{r}
for ( i in c(1,3,5,7,12) ) {
  print(i)
}
```

## While

```{r}
i <- 1
while (i <= 5) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
}
```

# Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. We just saw the Arithmetic operators..

## Assignment 

```{r}
assign("variableName", 2) # https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/assign.html
variableName
```

But we generally use the "<-" operator to assign a variable

```{r}
a <- 17
```

The reason why "=" should be avoided is cause it is mathematically incorrect in some situations:

```{r}
i <- 1
while (i <= 5) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1 # we saw this before!
}
```


## How to choose a good name for a variable?

Variable and function names should use only lowercase letters, numbers, and "_". Use underscores ("_") (so called **snake case**) to separate words within a name. Alternative you can use the **BigCamelCase** convention. Just be consistent.. it is hard, takes time.

```{r}
a <- 7 # poor name.. what is "a"? e.g. could be the 7th day of the week: Sunday? Or the age of Arianna
sunday <- 7 # still difficult to read in the "environment" 
sunday_index <- 7 # better
arianna_age <- 7 # ok, snake case
AriannaAge <- 7 # ok, BigCamelCase.. but still.. if Arianna is alive she might grow?
fede_age <- (lubridate::year(Sys.time()) - 1989) # guess what is this constant..
```

```{r}
`why this will not be fun!` <- 11 
`why this will not be fun!` # https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/make.names.html
```

# Functions

We can create our functions... be carefull that the chance that some function (optimized) already exist.. is high! Better to read the documentation.. I'll show a good example on week3.

Here an example of a really futile function.. with also a terrible name.. 

```{r}
my_function <- function() { # create a function with the name my_function
  print("Hello Cal!")
}
```

This function still exist.. any guess??

## Here another interesting creature:

```{r}
# going "inception"
i <- n <- 1 # permutations with repetitions ! n^k
while (i <= 3 ) { 
    for (j in 1:3 ) {
        for (k in 1:3) {
            print(paste0(i, "-", j, "-", k))
            n <- n + 1
        }
    }
    i <- i + 1
}
print((n - 1))
```

Better?

```{r}
expand.grid(rep(list(1:3),3)) # permutations with repetitions ! n^k
#?expand.grid()
```

# Be creative... not too much

## Excercise

Goal: Calculate O3 concentration in ppb and ug/m3

Data:

- Formula: μg/m3 = (ppb)\*(12.187)\*(M) / (273.15 + °C)
where M is the molecular weight of the gaseous pollutant. An atmospheric pressure of 1 atmosphere is assumed.
- Molecular weight (M) for O3 = 48 g/mol
- ppb CO2 in atmosphere is ~ 4000 == 400 ppm

```{r}
ugmc_conv <- function(ppb, M, Temp) {
  ugmc <- ppb * (12.187) * M / (273.15 + Temp)
  return(ugmc)
}

M_O3 <- 48
ppb_O3 <- 1
ext_T <- 25

round(ugmc_conv(ppb_O3, M_O3, ext_T))
```

### Calculate CO2 concentration in mg/m3 from ppm

# Plots

## Scatter Plot

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(3, 7, 8, 9, 12)

plot(x, y,
     main="My Graph", 
     xlab="The x-axis", ylab="The y axis",
     type = "o",
     col= "firebrick",
     cex=1,
     pch=19
     )
```

## Boxplot

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
a <- as.character(c(rep("Male",100), rep("Female",100)))
b <- as.numeric(c(runif(n = 100, min = 175 , max = 180),
       runif(n = 100, min = 165, max = 170)
       ))
c <- as.factor(round(runif(n = 200, min = 1, max = 3)))

df <- data.frame(cbind(a,b,c))
glimpse(df)

df$a <- as.factor(df$a)
df$b <- as.numeric(df$b)
df$c <- as.factor(df$c)
glimpse(df)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df,aes(a,b))+geom_boxplot(aes(fill=c))
```
