# In summary

During this first class will play around with R in RStudio (and a little on Jupiter..). We will use (as much as I can!) the Tidyverse programming style! The Tidy's wizard in the room is Tom actually.. 

# What do you need

Here in Berkeley you have access to Jupyter and Rstudio: <https://datahub.berkeley.edu/>! Use this resources to try both IDEs. Limitation: we just realized you can’t install external software (e.g. “eplus”. We will need it in week4)

So… for this class you will need to install R on your laptop. You can find it here: https://cloud.r-project.org

R do not comes with RStudio (.. make sense), which is the main IDE for R. You can install the RStudio Desktop from here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/

# Ready to go?

So... now that you are all set (right!?) it is time to:

- Open RStudio
- New Project (top-right)
- Choose "Version Control"
  - In "Repository url" copy-paste <https://github.com/CenterForTheBuiltEnvironment/R-for-Building-Science>
  - "Project directory name" should be updated automatically..
  - Click "Browse..."" (Create a subdirectory in your filesystem e.g. "/Documents/ARCH249_Mod3_2022")
- Click "Create Project"
  
Wow!... lot's of stuff! And [GitHub](https://github.com/) seems great right?! 

Yes it is: next week you'll *just* have to go in the "Git" panel inside the RStudio "Environment" window (usually the top right window of the IDE) and click on "Pull" to download the updates!

But... :smiling_imp:

Please do not modify the files we are giving to you.. create copies and work on those or we will have "conflicts".. and we don't have time to solve them so:

Alright, now that you're advised we should be ready to start!!
